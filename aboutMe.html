    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>  In October 2020, I made the decision to leave my career in financial services and my employer of ten years in order to retrain as a full stack engineer. During this time I have been working hard to develop a firm understanding of html, css, javascript (including jQuery), python, php, java and C#.</p>
    <p>My last role in financial services was as the Director of Compliance for a national financial advice firm.  I therefore have the project oversight experience, people management skills and a mind for all-things technical that you would expect from an experienced executive.  I also have an indepth working knowldege of data protection issues including compliance with GDPR regulations.</p>
    <p>During my career, I have developed a number of financial modelling tools using Excel and Visual Basic for Applications, all designed to make my life easier.  In my last role, I built from scratch an intergated fact finding tool for use with the firm's customers that would then generate a financial advice report based on their individual personal and financial circumstances. This application was used successfully with thousands of customers and gave me a real taste for developing my own systems and tools.</p>
    <p>At the moment, I am still developing my portfolio.  Please visit the <a href="myPortfolio.html">'My Portfolio'</a>  section for more details on what I have been working on.</p>
